# Souq ETF

This repository contains all the core smart contract source code for Souq ETF. The repository uses Hardhat as development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

# What is Souq?

Souq has developed on-chain ETFs that are constructed of baskets of high quality tokens from revenue-generating protocols that meet a stringent set of inclusion criteria. Not only this, but most of these tokens can be staked to generate yield. This provides investors with sustainable yield, as well as thematic token appreciation exposure to whichever sector the ETF is focused on. We're excited to bring this battle tested asset class to the DeFi ecosystem, as we think it has the potential to fuel wealth creation for the new global retail investor class.

## Getting Started

### Extra Documentation and Tutorials
The project is run as a Hardhat-based project, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [Hardhat Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the
- [Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.
- [Hardhat Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial): Full hardhat tutorial

### Sensible Defaults

This repository comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .commitlintrc.yml
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhintignore
├── .solhint.json
├── .yarnrc.yml
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### GitHub Actions

This repository comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must use your `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` and your `MNEMONIC` as GitHub secrets.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Conventional Commits

This repository enforces the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for git commit
messages. This is a lightweight convention that creates an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write
automated tools on top of.

### Git Hooks

This repository uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run automated checks on commit messages, and
[Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format the code with Prettier when making a git
commit.

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an
environment variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use
this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

The hardhat.config.ts template should be added to the directory and compiler set to 0.8.10

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

To test specific script:

```sh
$ npx hardhat test test/<Sub_Folder>/<File_Name>.spec.ts
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy --welcome "Hello, welcome"
```
Goerli Testnet

```sh
$ npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Tips

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.
